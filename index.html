	<title>College Prediction Model: Engineering or Not</title>

<body>
<div class="text">
	<center > <h1>Engineering-or-not Prediction Model</h1> </center>

	<p>The people who I am basing this model is a combination of people I knew from my classes, my old high school and the running club I participate in during college. </p>
	<p>Some people who are taking this survey are also random friends I met on campus with no affilation to my classes or the running club.</p>
	<p>As a result there is a nice diversity of majors. However, there was not enough of a sample to predict all majors well.</p>
	<p>As a result I predicted whether someone was in the college of engineering or not, because I had the most people from that department.</p>
	<P>To view the profile of the people who took this survey, <a href="survey_profile.html"> CLICK HERE </a>.</P>
	<P>NOTE: The slides in the slideshow for that link might upload slowly, because I am using tableau to create the visualization.</a>.</P>
	<P>This model was extracted by a function, using the <i> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akaike_information_criterion">Akaike Information Criterion</a> </i> tool in R Programming. I created as simplified and accurate of a model as I could.</P>
	<P>The criterion penalizes both having too many variables and too much of an error residual. Here is the model:</P>

	<p> 1 = Male, 2 = Gender not male or female, 3 = Loves Major, 4 = Stressed Out, 5 = Reads Sometimes, 6 = Bookworm, 7 = Tuition Paid Mostly by Financial Aid</p>
	<p> 8 = No Financial Aid, 9 = Partial Financial Aid, 10 = Virginity at 16 or 17, 11 = Minority, 12 = Likes Adventure Movies, 13 = Likes Action Movies, 14 = Does not Game, 15 = Games Sometimes</p>
	<p> The reason this model includes a subset of all variables is because a lot of variables not included have covariance with the variables already in the model.</p>
	<p>However, if you are curious in seeing the effects of all the different factors in the questions I included in the survey, here is a more comprehensive list: </p>
